Project 2: Using a Third Party API

Remember way back in the warm-up when you played with the Flickr API? Now it's time for you to actually use it. Huzzah! You'll create a simple photo widget that allows you to display photos from your Flickr feed (or someone else's). We'll rely on a tutorial for much of the heavy lifting but the principles of what you do here will be repeatable for use with other APIs.  

This project is heavily based on the tutorial from Pixelatted visions http://www.pixellatedvisions.com/2009/04/06/integrating-flickr-into-your-rails-website and implemented using the FlickRaw gem.
